  <h2 class="fsv-4 text-rose-3">How to join</h2>
  <h3 class="fsv-5 font-sans">If you're a developer…</h3>
  <p>Go to the Pinoy Bloggers Github repository and <a href="https://github.com/teacherbuknoy/ph-webring/compare">open a pull request</a>. Follow these instructions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/teacherbuknoy/ph-webring/">the repository</a> and clone your fork to your local machine.</li>
    <li>
      In the file <code>src/data/members.json</code>, add your entry. You'll need to add the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>title</code>: the title of your website</li>
        <li>
          <code>url</code>: the URL of your website</li>
        <li>
          <code>feeds</code>: an array of your RSS feeds. You can leave this out if your website doesn't have one. But if you do, these are what you need for each entry:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>name</code>: the name for this RSS feed.</li>
            <li>
              <code>url</code>: the url for this RSS feed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      This is an example of an entry in <code>members.json</code>:
      {% highlight "json" %}[
…
  {
    "title": "Francis Rubio",
    "url": "https://francisrubio.antaresph.dev/",
    "feeds": [
      { "name": "Everything", "url": "https://francisrubio.antaresph.dev/feed.xml" },
      { "name": "Posts", "url": "https://francisrubio.antaresph.dev/blog.xml" },
      { "name": "Literature", "url": "https://francisrubio.antaresph.dev/literature.xml" },
      { "name": "Videos", "url": "https://francisrubio.antaresph.dev/videos.xml" }
    ]
  }
…
]{% endhighlight %}
    </li>
  </ol>
